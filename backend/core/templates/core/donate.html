                <h3>Why Your Donation Matters</h3>
                <p>
                    Unlike traditional software companies, we're not driven by profit margins or shareholder demands. Our sole focus is on building the best possible tools for our community of creators. Every contribution, no matter the size, directly funds our development, server costs, and allows us to expand our library of free templates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By donating, you're not just supporting a project; you're investing in a more accessible and creative web.
                </p>
